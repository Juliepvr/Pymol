EX 6


PyMOL> fetch 2JQY

PyMOL> split_states 2JQY   (https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Split_states (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.)

You will now see 10 conformers each in a separate object

PyMOL> hide all

PyMOL> show cartoon

The differences are mainly in the loops on the surface of the barrel structure.

You may color these differently to see the differences even better.

Click all (layers) to hide them and only show object 2JQY_0001 by clicking on the object name.

PYMOL> fetch 2IWW

PyMOL> hide all

PyMOL> show cartoon, 2IWW + 2JQY_0001

PyMOL> hide cartoon, 2IWW and chain B

PyMOL> align 2IWW and chain A, 2JQY_0001

PyMOL> zoom

2JQY_align.png

Rotate the structures and take a closer look at the flexible loop which can close the channel (barrel structure).

Also nice visualization in surface representation:

PyMOL> show surface

Color each structure  differently. Optionally also color the loop to make to difference more clear.

PyMOL> color ..., 2IWW and resi 219-232

File » Save Session As…

PyMOL> delete 2JQY_*    (this will remove all conformers and only keep object 2JQY)

PyMOL> fetch 1Q55

PyMOL> hide all

PyMOL> show cartoon

PyMOL> create calcium, 1Q55 and chain A+B and resn CA

PyMOL> show spheres, calcium

PyMOL> color firebrick, 1Q55 and chain A

PyMOL> color skyblue, 1Q55 and chain B

PyMOL> create trparm, 1Q55 and resi 2

PyMOL> show sticks, trparm

PyMOL> set valence, 0
PyMOL> show surface, 1Q55 and chain A

The N-terminal adhesion arm of one chain is inserted into the other chain (termed strand swapping) using the Trp (W2) as anchor residue into a hydrophobic pocket.The surface representation is somehow weird because chain A is "opened" by chain B. This will not be the case if you put the chains in different objects.

PyMOL> create chaina, 1Q55 and chain A

PyMOL> create chainb, 1Q55 and chain B

Click on the object 1Q55 to hide.

PyMOL> set transparency = 0.2
